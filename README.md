# project-template

A summarization of our SGC boards with reminders and a short checklist based on the Project Handbook. 

It was created to address the concern raised during our cohort Stop-Go-Continue session:

***"We write these things down, agree it's important but forget to apply it in our projects"***

## Reminders
- Breaks are not optional, the frequency is.
- Got stuck? Go for a walk!
- All code should be reviewed by someone other than yourself
- Learning is our priority! Lower the expectations. Learning > Building
- More time planning at the beginning will result in less time having to code. 
- Struggling to make a decision/assign issues? [Randomize!](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/lollipop/?names=Abby%2CAbdullah%2CAlex%2CJoe%2CKarwan%2CLisa%2CManoela%2CPatrick%2CPaz%2CSumithra%2CSuraj%2CYassien)
- Writing clean code and refactoring as you go often results in less time debugging. Trying to fix an issue in a messy codebase is a recipe for headaches...

## Checklist
- [ ] Use correct repo name: `week#-<topic>-<team members' names or initials>`
- [ ] Create the Project Board
- [ ] Assign Roles
- [ ] Write User Stories 
- [ ] Break User Stories into smaller issues for assignment
- [ ] Estimate time ([script to create labels automatically](https://github.com/fac25/project-template/blob/main/add-labels.js))

## Working on Issues
- [ ] Break the issue into small 'steps'
- [ ] Plan and use pseudocode before writing code
